AINSLEY: GHOST! In the woods!

OFFSCREEN: Barely escaped with my life!!
ANTHONY: Piper!

AINSLEY: Just the most dreadful wailing...
PIPER: What kind of ghost?
ANTHONY: Piper, don't be rude!

PIPER: Did it have big bitey teeth?
ANTHONY: Piper.

PIPER: I should tell you, I'm a professional ghost-catcher.
ANTHONY: Piper!

ANTHONY: Piper-
PIPER: ANTHONY, WHAT!

ANTHONY: Stop it! Can't you see they've already gone through a lot!

TESS: Why don't you ask Walter for some tea for Ainsley?
PIPER: My talents are wasted.
